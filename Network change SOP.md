## **Network change SOP**
## <u>*Purpose:*</u>
>  The purpose of this procedure is to establish a process for managing changes to the network while minimizing disruptions and downtime. This procedure ensures that all changes are managed in a consistent and controlled manner.

## <u>Scope</u>
> This procedure applies to all network hardware, software, and configuration changes.

 
## <u>Responsibilities</u>
> - Network administrators are responsible for planning and implementing changes to the network while minimizing disruptions and downtime.
> - Network engineers are responsible for reviewing and approving all network changes.
> - End-users are responsible for reporting any network-related issues to the network administrators.

## <u>Prerequisites</u>
> - Network Architecture: Understand the network architecture of your organization.
> - Network Segmentation: Ensure that the network is segmented properly to facilitate efficient monitoring.
> - Access Controls: Ensure that access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the network monitoring tool and the captured data.
> - Monitoring Policies: Set policies for monitoring network traffic, including the scope and frequency of monitoring, the protocols to monitor, and the actions to take in response to identified issues.

 
## <u>Procedures</u>
 -  **Step 1:** Identify the Need for Change
> - The network administrator must identify the need for change and document it in the change management system.
The network administrator should evaluate the impact of the proposed change and determine the risks involved.
 - **Step 2:** Plan the Change
> - The network administrator must create a detailed plan for implementing the change.
> - The plan should include the resources required, timelines, and any potential risks associated with the change.
> - The network administrator must obtain approval from the network engineers before proceeding.
 - **Step 3:** Test the Change
> - Before implementing the change, the network administrator must perform testing in a controlled environment to ensure that the change does not disrupt the network.
>- The network administrator should document the results of the testing and obtain approval from the network engineers before proceeding.
 - **Step 4:** Implement the Change
> - The network administrator should implement the change during a scheduled maintenance window to minimize disruptions and downtime.
> - The network administrator should have a rollback plan in case of any issues during the implementation process.
> - The network administrator should document the implementation process and update the change management system accordingly.
> - **Step 5:** Verify the Change
> - After the change has been implemented, the network administrator should perform verification testing to ensure that the change has been successfully implemented.
> - The network administrator should document the results of the verification testing and update the change management system accordingly.
> - **Step 6:** Monitor and Review
> - The network administrator should monitor the network for any issues following the implementation of the change.
> - The network administrator should review the change management process and make any necessary improvements to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
